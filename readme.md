# TRADFRI-DAYLIGHT

Tradfri-Daylight is a node.js typescript application that controls all the dimmable lights in your Ikea Tr√•dfri gateway by fading the dimmers between specified times. It also lowers the temperature of the lights before sunrise and sunsets, with given fade durations for morning and twilight.

## Setup

1. Run `npm i`,
2. Manipulate the `options.json` file if needed. See chart below for explanations. See a chart of the results by running `npm test`,
3. Check the back of your gateway for the security key and export it as env var IKEASECURITY. Bash: `export IKEASECURITY=code`, powershell: `$env:IKEASECURITY='code'`. _You only need to do this once; the resulting token is saved by the Conf package._
4. Run `npm start`,

| key                 | scalar  | explanation                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dimmerMax           | percent | The maximum brightness to dim to.                                 |
| dimmerMin           | percent | The minimum brightness to dim to.                                 |
| fadeInAt            | hour    | Hour of the day to start fading in.                               |
| fullyLitAt          | hour    | Hour of the day where brightness reaches maximum.                 |
| fadeOutAt           | hour    | Hour of the day to start fading out brightness.                   |
| fullyDimmedAt       | hour    | Hour of the day where brightness reaches minimum.                 |
| temperatureMin      | percent | The coldest light temperature (typically midday).                 |
| temperatureMax      | percent | The warmest light temperature (early mornings and late evenings). |
| temperatureMaxBySun | percent | The warmest light temperature that is allowed to be set by twilight approaching. Setting this to something lower than `temperatureMax` creates a sort of shelf in the evening, where light doesnt get warmer even though the sun may have set - until the brightness dimmer brings it up in reverse to itself. |
| morningHours        | hour    | The fade in duration of cold light after sunrise.                 |
| twilightHours       | hour    | The fade in duration of warm light after sunset.                  |
