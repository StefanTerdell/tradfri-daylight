# TRADFRI-DAYLIGHT

Tradfri-Daylight is a node.js typescript application that controls your Ikea Tr√•dfri lights to keep the temperature in sync with the sun and also dim them up in the mornings and down in the evenings.

There are 4 programs (wakeup, sunrise, sunset and sleep) which follow these simple rules:
- The wakeup program will always start dimming up at a set time but only transition the color temperature if the transition starts before the sunrise program.
- The sunrise program will always start transitioning the color but start dimming up only if the transition starts before the wakeup program.
- The sunset program will only dim down the lights and set the temperature if it starts before the sleep program.
- The sleep program will always dim down the lights and temperature.

All times in `option.json` are treated as hours, ie: 13.5 corresponds to 1:30 PM.
